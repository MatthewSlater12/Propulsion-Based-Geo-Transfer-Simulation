# Propulsion-Based-Geo-Transfer-Simulation
This reposity contains the counterpart to my other work, this project simulates the use of propulsive methods to move from an initial set of orbits to the geostationary ring. The delta V and time of flight is then calculated for these methods as a point of baseline comparison to the luna assist methods in the other part of the project
